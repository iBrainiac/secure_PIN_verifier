Secure_PIN_Verification_using_Quadratic_Residues_and_Random_Challenges


This Rust program demonstrates a safe PIN verification mechanism that employs quadratic residues and random challenges. It entails a trusted third party (TTP) configuration and an interactive protocol between a cardholder and a card reader.

The program contains;

Quadratic Residues to verify if a number is a quadratic residue modulo n (product of two primes).

GCD Calculation to Compute the greatest common divisor to ensure coprimeness.

Random Challenges: Uses random values in the verification process to ensure security.
